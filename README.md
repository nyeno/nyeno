# Who am I

I am Laura and sometimes, I call myself taeyang which is Korean for "the sun". I am a student, a web developer and a data analyst. I am a dreamer too, I believe in dreams. Uhmm, I am also a teacher, I really enjoy teaching people the things I know. I love when my knowledge helps someone, makes their life easier or maybe just makes their code run. I am always seeking to learn something new especially in tech. Welcome to my github page.

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out my Github page. A lot of the code here is in CSS because I absolulutely love CSS. I complete a frontend mentor challenge as often as I can just to keep my CSS skills sharp. I work on other things as well, Angular, etc. 

There are lots of challenges from [frontend mentors](https://www.frontendmentor.io) for you to check out and hop on. You can join their [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) as well.

You are on the right path in your coding journey. It might be tasking and sometimes frustrating but it can also be immensely rewarding. I hope you keep coding and just generally doing the things you love. X
